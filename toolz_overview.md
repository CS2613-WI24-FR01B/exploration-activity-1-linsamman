**Toolz Library Overview**

**1. Which package/library did you select?**

I selected the Toolz library, a Python library for functional programming utilities.

**2. What is the package/library?**

The Toolz library provides a set of utility functions for functional programming in Python. It offers tools for function composition, currying, and other functional programming paradigms.

Purpose:
The purpose of the Toolz library is to provide developers with convenient and efficient tools for functional programming tasks in Python. It aims to enhance code readability, maintainability, and expressiveness by promoting functional programming principles.

**How do you use it?**

To use the Toolz library, you first need to install it via pip:
1-pip install toolz
2-Once installed, you can import the desired functions from the Toolz library
and apply them to your functional programming tasks.

Functions like pipe, map, filter, and valfilter are commonly used for function composition, data manipulation, and filtering operations.

```python
from toolz import pipe, map

# Example of using pipe function
result = pipe(
    [1, 2, 3],
    (map(lambda x: x * 2))
)
print(result)  # Output: [2, 4, 6]
```



**4. When was it created?**

The Toolz library was created by Matthew Rocklin and contributors. The initial commit was made on May 3, 2013, according to the GitHub repository.

**5. Why did you select this package/library?**
I selected the Toolz library because it aligns with the goals of the exploration activity, 
which include exploring a package/library for functional programming and enhancing creativity in programming. 
The Toolz library offers powerful tools for functional programming tasks in Python, allowing for expressive and elegant code solutions.
Additionally, I found the Toolz library particularly helpful for the program I was planning to create, which involves managing and processing student grades.
The functional programming capabilities provided by Toolz would streamline data manipulation tasks, such as filtering, mapping, and aggregating student grades, 
ultimately leading to more efficient and maintainable code.

**6. How did learning the package/library influence your learning of the language?**

Learning the Toolz library has enhanced my understanding of functional programming concepts in Python. It has introduced me to functional programming paradigms and techniques, such as function composition and currying, which have broadened my approach to problem-solving and code design.

**7. How was your overall experience with the package/library?**

My overall experience with the Toolz library has been positive. The library provides a clean and intuitive API for functional programming tasks, making it easy to use and understand. I would recommend this library to Python developers interested in exploring functional programming concepts or looking for tools to enhance their codebase's readability and maintainability.
